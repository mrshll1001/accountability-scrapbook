# About
An open-source collections management tool designed to facilitate the linking of spending and evidencing to provide a narrative context for financial transparency and accountability... that's the theory anyway.

This is being developed as part of PhD research performed by myself (Matt) at Newcastle University. If you have any questions or issues feel free to contact me: [m.marshall@newcastle.ac.uk](mailto:m.marshall@newcastle.ac.uk). The app is being developed in the context of *small charities and Non-Profits*. However, I'm interested in other use-cases as well.

Enjoy, and if there's an issue with the source (bad security, filthy code) then raise an issue and I'll get on it. I'm releasing it under the GPL 3. Keep software Free.
